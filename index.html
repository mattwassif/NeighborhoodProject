            NYC Clean Heat Program, driven by The New York State Energy Research & Development Authority, has successfully transformed the city's energy landscape by eliminating heavy heating oils and significantly 
            reducing PM2.5 emissions. The DEP Boiler Registration and Greener, Greater Buildings Plan further contribute to monitoring and improving environmental performance in buildings, emphasizing transparency and
            providing support for compliance. The city's efforts to transition to clean heating fuels, including the promotion of technologies like air and ground source pumps and the implementation of the Utility Rebate
            Program, demonstrate a commitment to achieving a 40% reduction in CO2 emissions and sourcing 70% of electricity from clean renewable energy by 2030. These initiatives collectively reflect New York's dedication
            to sustainability, environmental health, and a greener urban future.
