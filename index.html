            Having a cat as a pet is a great idea if you do not have all the time in the world. Cats, compared to dogs,
            require much less physical activity, and do most things on their own. Cats walk themselves, and do not need
            to go outside to use the bathroom. They sleep most of the day and you can trust that they wont bother you.
            They can also be very affectionate, but only if they are in the mood and are comfortable with you. Some pros
            include, being low-maintenance, they can eat or chase away pests, they dont require a lot of room, and they
            can be very fun! Some cons are, they shed, their litter boxes need to be cleaned regularly, and they can
            sometimes be very vocal.(although not as loud as a dog barking of course) Cats are really amazing pets!
